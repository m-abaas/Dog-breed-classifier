# Dog breed classifier

## Introduction
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.

## Project goal
This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network to classify dogs according to their breed. If a human image was inserted, the network tells which breed the human looks like the most. If anything rather than a dog or a human was inserted, the network produces no output. The notebook in this repositery has all the steps of building, training and examining the network on a step by step basis.
